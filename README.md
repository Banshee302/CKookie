# CKookie
CKookie is a fast and simple HTTP file sharing Protocol written in C built for Speed and Small resource Usage.

# Usage

If you want to build from source just run the gmake binary included in the Package, ./gmake and it should just build everything lightning fast, to ping your server just do curl (server_ip):12345/(filename).(file-extension)

CKookie runs in Port 12345, so use that Port for curling the Server.

If your hosting it yourself, just do localhost:12345/(filename).(file-extension)
